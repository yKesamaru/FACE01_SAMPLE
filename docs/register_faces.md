When using on FACE01, make the *height 200px and width 200px*.


## Put face images in the `preset_images` folder.

When you start the application, it automatically converts the face image into 128D ndarray data.

**NOTE**
If you want to delete other face image files in the `preset_images` folder, move them to the `debug` folder before starting the application.
