# Want to benchmark?

Try `example/benchmark_CUI.py` in the same examples folder.

Your browser will automatically display a very cool and easy to use graph using `snakeviz`.

Unfortunately, the prepared Docker Image does not have a browser installed, so the browser will not open automatically. If you have it installed on your system, the benchmark page will open automatically just before the application exits.
